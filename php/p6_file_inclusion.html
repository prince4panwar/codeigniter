    <h1>File Inclusion</h1>
     
    <h3>In PHP, you can include the content of one file within another file using the include, require, include_once, and require_once statements. File inclusion is a common technique for reusing code, separating code into manageable files, and building modular applications. Here's an overview of these file inclusion methods:-</h3>
    
    <h3>1. include Statement:</h3>
    <p>  The include statement is used to include and evaluate a file.
        If the included file is not found, it generates a warning, but the script continues to execute.
        The include statement is often used for non-essential file inclusions, such as templates, libraries, or optional components.</p>
    <h3>2. require Statement:</h3>
    <p>The require statement is used to include and evaluate a file, just like include.
        However, if the included file is not found, it generates a fatal error and terminates the script.</p>

    <div class="source_code">
        // Example of using include <br>
        include 'my_file.php';<br>

        // Rest of your PHP code<br>
        echo "This code is after the include statement.";<br>

        // Example of using require<br>
        require 'my_file.php';<br>

        // Rest of your PHP code<br>
        echo "This code is after the require statement.";<br>
    </div>
    <h3>my_file.php</h3>
    <div class="source_code">
        echo "include and require is working properly"; <br>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Output :- </h3>
    <div class="Output">
        
        include and require is working properly <br>
        This code is after the include statement. <br>
        include and require is working properly <br>
        This code is after the require statement. <br>
    </div>
    <script>
        function copyCode() {
        var code = document.querySelector("pre code");
        var textArea = document.createElement("textarea");
        textArea.value = code.textContent;
        document.body.appendChild(textArea);
        textArea.select();
        document.execCommand('copy');
        document.body.removeChild(textArea);
        alert("Code copied to clipboard");
}
