    <h1>File Handling</h1>
     
    <h3>File handling in PHP allows you to perform various operations on files, including reading, writing, creating, deleting, and more. PHP provides a set of functions and methods for file manipulation. Here's an overview of common file handling tasks in PHP :-    </h3>

    <h2>There are some steps of using file handling :-</h2>
    <h3>1. Opening a File:</h3> 
    <h3>To work with a file, you must open it using the fopen() function.</h3>
    <h3> fopen function takes two parameters: the file path and the mode  For example: </h3>
    <h3>"r" for reading</h3>
    <h3>"w" for writing</h3>
    <h3>"a" for appending</h3>
    <div class="source_code">
        //  Opening a File:<br>
        $file = fopen("example.txt", "r");  // Opens "example.txt" for reading.<br>
    </div>

    <h3>2. Reading from a File:</h3>
    <h3>If you opened the file in read mode, you can read its contents using functions like fgets(), fread(), or file_get_contents():</h3>
    <div class="source_code">
    // Reading from a File:<br>
    $content = fread($file, filesize("example.txt"));  // Reads the entire file content.<br>
    </div>

    <h3>3. Writing to a File:</h3>
    <h3>To write to a file, you need to open it in write mode ("w"):</h3>
    <div class="source_code">
    // Writing to a File:<br>
    $file = fopen("output.txt", "w");<br>
    fwrite($file, "Hello, world!");<br>
    </div>

    <h3>4. Appending to a File:</h3>
    <h3>To append content to an existing file without overwriting it, use append mode ("a"):</h3>
    <div class="source_code">
    // Appending to a File:<br>
    $file = fopen("existing_file.txt", "a");<br>
    fwrite($file, "Appending some text.");<br>
    </div>

    <h3>5. Closing a File:</h3>
    <h3>It's important to close the file when you're done to release system resources. Use the fclose() function:</h3>
    <div class="source_code">
    // Closing a File:<br>
    fclose($file);<br>
    </div>
